Trauma / Emergency Radiologist,"University of Maryland, Baltimore",Baltimore US,,https://jobs.chronicle.com/job/6005/trauma-emergency-radiologist/?utm_campaign=google_jobs_apply&utm_source=google_jobs_apply&utm_medium=organic,"The Trauma and Emergency Radiology Section serves patients at the
R. Adams Cowley Shock Trauma Center and University of Maryland
Medical Center Emergency Department. Specializing in diagnostic
imaging for patients experiencing acute traumatic and non-traumatic
medical emergencies, including severe multi-system trauma,
radiologists work with both medical and surgical specialists to
provide comprehensive patient evaluation.

The mission of the Trauma and Emergency Radiology Section is to
provide rapid, comprehensive and expert clinical radiology service
to patients, while also advancing the use of non-invasive imaging
in Trauma care through research and education. In addition to the
Shock Trauma Center, the section serves the patients of the
University of Maryland Medical Center’s Adult Emergency
Department.

Description

The Department of Diagnostic Radiology and Nuclear Medicine at the
University of Maryland School of Medicine seeks a full-time,
faculty radiologist to be a member of the expanding Emergency
Radiology section of its Division of Emergency and Trauma Imaging
(ETI).

This position is for an American Board of Radiology board certified
or board eligible radiologist. The successful candidate will
preferably be either Emergency Radiology fellowship trained in or
both strongly interested in and experienced with the practice of
contemporary Emergency Radiology. However, strong candidates with
fellowship training in other areas, particularly Neuroradiology and
Body Imaging, will be considered. Candidates should be comfortable
with the broad scope of emergency and acute care imaging, including
radiograph, CT/CTA, MRI/MRA, and US (no nuclear medicine,
fluoroscopy, or interventional procedures).

Clinical responsibilities will include coverage of the academic
Emergency Department of the University of Maryland Medical
Center-Downtown Campus, as well as emergency studies originating in
the Department of Radiology’s expanding Community Radiology
enterprise, which includes four community-based acute care
hospitals and a free-standing emergency care center. Though
coverage of the University of Maryland Shock Trauma Center will
primarily be provided by the subsection of Trauma Radiology, the
candidate should be comfortable with basic trauma imaging. The
candidate will be expected to provide on-site coverage at the
UMMC-Downtown campus, which will include resident supervision,
while assisting with remote coverage of other sites. Given the
nexus of responsibilities, the Emergency Radiology section works
closely with the expanding Community Radiology section, potentially
leading to opportunities to either work on-site at one of the
practice’s other affiliated centers or work remotely from
home.

Qualifications :

The ETI and Community Radiology divisions have strong working
relationships with Emergency Medicine Departments at its
affiliates, as well as Trauma Surgery and Acute Care Surgery at the
UMMC-Downtown Campus, providing for a collegial work environment
and opportunities for both clinical and academic
collaboration.

The candidate will be expected to provide on-site resident and
fellow supervision during clinical coverage, as well as participate
in the didactic lecture series for the Radiology residency. While
administrative and academic activities are strongly encouraged and
supported, they are not mandatory for this position. The work
schedule will have a strong focus on sustainability and a favorable
work/life balance.

The expected start date is July 2020 for graduating fellows, though
earlier start dates for other candidates will be viewed
favorably.

We proudly offer competitive salaries and comprehensive benefits.
Faculty rank is commensurate with candidate’s qualifications and
experience. Expected rank is Assistant Professor (non-tenure track)
or higher. However, rank and corresponding salary are dependent on
the candidate's qualifications and experience.

• Receive 4 days of basic pay for only 2 days worked (16 hours) each drill weekend
• Opportunities to acquire new skills and sharpen existing ones, enhancing your civilian career
• Educational assistance
• Tax-free, worldwide Navy Exchange and commissary privileges for you and your family
• VA guaranteed home loans
• Low-cost insurance options, including up to $400,000 in life insurance

• Retirement after 20 qualifying years
• TRICARE

QUALIFICATIONS AND REQUIREMENTS
• U.S. citizen or equivalent
